Also have a look at some of the other **NXP GitBooks**:

* [HoverGames Drone](https://nxp.gitbook.io/hovergames/)  
* [NavQ Companion Computer](https://nxp.gitbook.io/8mmnavq/)   
* [UCANS32K UAVCAN Node](https://nxp.gitbook.io/ucans32k146/)   
* [RDDRONE-BMS772 Battery Management System](https://nxp.gitbook.io/rddrone-bms772/)   
* [D2X Reference Design](https://nxp.gitbook.io/d2x/)   
* [NXP Cup](https://nxp.gitbook.io/nxp-cup-hardware-reference-alamak/)â€‹

The 8MMNavQ is a small purpose built experimental Linux computer based on the [NXP i.MX 8M Mini SOC](https://www.nxp.com/products/processors-and-microcontrollers/arm-processors/i-mx-applications-processors/i-mx-8-processors:IMX8-SERIES). It is focused on the common needs of Mobile Robotics systems.

The system is built as a stack of boards, the top board being a SOM \(system on module\) containing the Processor, memory and other components with strict layout requirements, and where the secondary boards are relatively inexpensive \(often 4 layer boards\) and allows for versions with customization to be easily built.  
This is a brand new set of boards and software enablement will undergo several iterations. Our intent is to provide a "friendly Linux" with typical packages and additional tools included rather than the typical highly optimized and stripped down Linux found in deeply embedded products.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please check for Linux updates regularly. Feedback and needs will be incorporated and updated as much as possible and reasonable.

There is a [discussion forum here for questions specifically about NavQ](https://community.nxp.com/community/mobilerobotics/hovergames-drone-challenge/navq-8mmnavq-discussion)

And a general [HoverGames forum](https://community.nxp.com/community/mobilerobotics/hovergames-drone-challenge) here.

The 8MMNavQ features:

1. NXP i.MX 8M Mini SOM with LPDDR4 DRAM and eMMC Flash.
2. A secondary board with SDCARD, Networking, MIPI-CSI \(Camera\) and MIPI-DSI \(Display\) interfaces
   * MIPI-DSI to HDMI converter
   * A Google Coral camera module
3. A third HGI \(HoverGames Interposer board\) with common interfaces and specific drone and rover interfaces which follow PX4 standards.

## Applications

The NavQ is suitable for many purposes, including generic robots and various vision systems.

* Drones, QuadCopters, Unmanned Aircraft, VTOL
* Rovers
* Road going Delivery Vehicles
* Robotic Lawnmowers
* Robotic Vacuum
* Flying vehicles \(PX4\)
* DIYRobotCars
* Marine vessels
* Camera and Vision processing modules
* Time of Flight \(TOF\) Cameras
* AI/ML inference
* Cellular gateway
* Vision systems in other applications
  * e.g a hospital bed monitor that detects if a patient is sitting up or at risk of falling out of bed.

Two specific complete developer tool examples are the [NXP HoverGames Drone](https://nxp.gitbook.io/hovergames), and the NXP-CUP car.

{% hint style="info" %}
The NavQ was prepared with the intention of working with and supporting the NXP HoverGames Drone program
{% endhint %}

### Software

The intent of the 8MMNavQ in HoverGames is to enable participants with a solution that allows them to harness common robotics packages and libraries such as:

* ROS
* OpenCV
* GStreamer
* Tensorflow
* pyeIQ
* And more!

The 8MMNavQ runs linux with a package manager, so you should be able to install the packages that you need to complete your projects successfully and efficiently.
