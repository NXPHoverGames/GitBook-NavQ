# Power Cables

## NavQ Cables

The NavQ ships with several cables. They allow for several configurations when powering the NavQ

#### USB-C

When working on the bench you may wish to power the NavQ from USB-C input cable. This cable is provided. It would also be possible to power the NavQ while on a drone from a separate USB-C battery pack like those for Cell phone power. 

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note that some USB-C ports on charging adapters and particularly on unpowered Hubs may not supply enough current to run the NavQ and all the peripherals. If you notice a booting failure, please first try powering from an external battery or known high power USB-C charger or power supply.
