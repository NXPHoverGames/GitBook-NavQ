# Gazebo

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (47).png>)

[Gazebo ](http://gazebosim.org/)is one of several simulators that work with PX4 and ROS.&#x20;

Simulation is important in order to test code without risk of damaging real hardware. It can be critical in uncovering faults that would otherwise be very difficult to trigger.\
\
This is not a tutorial on [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/), but a list of some resources to get started.&#x20;

* PX4.io Gazebo developer guide [https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/simulation/gazebo.html](https://dev.px4.io/v1.9.0/en/simulation/gazebo.html)
* Youtube videos e.g. [https://youtu.be/mranHM9wn0g](https://youtu.be/mranHM9wn0g)
* Read about [Gazebo on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gazebo\_simulator).&#x20;
* Try out [this simple Gazebo tutorial to control a differential drive robot](http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros2\_installing\&cat=connect\_ros), which is a fun way to learn both Gazebo and ROS. (smile)&#x20;
